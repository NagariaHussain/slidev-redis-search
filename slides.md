  ## Search with RediSearch

# RediSearch

---

# The Problem

<v-click>

A feature-rich customizable E-commerce search.

![Problem](problem.png)

</v-click>

---

# The Solution

There were two options:

1. Whoosh

<v-click> 

- Works well for unstructured data, not suited for structured data (e.g. E-commerce Item data)

- Some hacks are required to get good `autocomplete` to work

- Becomes very slow when `autocomplete` and `fuzzy searching` are added

</v-click>
2. RediSearch

<v-click>

- Build with `structured` data in mind.

- Excellent build-in commands for `autocomplete`, `fuzzy searching` and also `filtering`

- Works with the existing indexed data in `Redis` cache

</v-click>

# Normal Searching with multiple fields

```bash {1|3-5|7-8|10-23}
$ redis-cli

# Inserting data into redis cache

> ...

# Creating a secondary index

# Searching the index

# Getting autocomplete suggesstions
